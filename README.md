Testing issues

## Project Overview
This repository documents the architectural patterns and logic used to resolve complex Input and Focus behaviors within the Android ecosystem. The primary focus was on surfacing focus and traversal issues and solutions for a best in class adaptive experience compliant with WCAG AA.

## Core Focus Areas
* Unified Traversal Logic: Methods for handling focus movement across disparate UI frameworks (Native vs. WebView) to ensure the user never "loses" their place.

*  Keyboard & TextField Interaction: Resolving edge cases in keyboard focus cycles and text input focus states.

*  Blocker Resolution: Tactical fixes for underlying system bugs that prevent Critical User Journeys (CUJs) from functioning as intended.

*  Accessibility (A11y): Implementing focus-order logic that meets WCAG AA standards for screen readers and hardware keyboard users.
